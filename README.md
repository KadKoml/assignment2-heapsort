# Heap Sort Implementation

## Algorithm Overview
Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It works by building a max heap from the input data, then repeatedly extracting the maximum element and maintaining the heap property.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**:
    - Best Case: O(n log n)
    - Worst Case: O(n log n)
    - Average Case: O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - In-place sorting

## Features
- In-place implementation
- Bottom-up heapify optimization
- Performance metrics tracking
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Usage
